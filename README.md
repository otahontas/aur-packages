## Description

This repo contains all the PKGBUILDS for [aur packages I maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=otahontas).

## Tests

Repo is also used to test if packages are being built correctly after I've updated them in AUR. Thanks to [Build AUR Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-aur-package) Github action for making this easy!
